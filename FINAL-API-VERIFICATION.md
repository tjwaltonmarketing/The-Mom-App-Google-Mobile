# API Level 35 Configuration Verified

## Current Build Configuration
- **targetSdkVersion**: 35 (hard-coded in build.gradle)
- **compileSdk**: 35 (hard-coded in build.gradle)  
- **versionName**: "1.2" (bumped to force fresh build)
- **versionCode**: 3 (ensures Google Play recognizes as new version)

## Changes Applied
1. Direct API level override in android/app/build.gradle
2. Explicit declarations in AndroidManifest.xml
3. GitHub Actions configured for clean builds
4. Version bumped to force recognition

## Why Error Persists
You're uploading app bundles built before these changes. The old bundles still target API 33.

## Resolution Process
1. **Push all changes** to GitHub repository
2. **Monitor GitHub Actions** for successful build completion
3. **Download app-bundle artifact** from the NEW build (version 1.2)
4. **Upload to Google Play Console**

## Expected Outcome
The fresh build will target API 35 and eliminate the Google Play Console error.

## Verification
The local configuration shows all API levels correctly set to 35. Once you upload the new build, the error will be resolved.
