# DEFINITIVE API LEVEL 35 FIX

## Problem
Google Play Console shows "API level 33" error despite configuration showing API 35.

## Root Cause  
You're uploading old app bundles built before the API level changes.

## Final Fix Applied

### 1. Direct API Level Override
- **android/app/build.gradle**: Hard-coded `targetSdkVersion 35` and `compileSdk 35`
- **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**: Added explicit API level declarations
- **Version**: Bumped to 1.2 (versionCode 3) to force fresh recognition

### 2. Build Process Updates
- **GitHub Actions**: Added clean step that removes all cached builds
- **Gradle**: Updated to latest version (8.2.2)
- **Verification**: Added API level checking during build

## Critical Next Steps

1. **Push ALL changes** to GitHub repository
2. **Wait for NEW GitHub Actions build** to complete (will take ~10-15 minutes)
3. **Download FRESH app-bundle** artifact (ignore old ones)
4. **Verify version shows 1.2** in the app bundle
5. **Upload to Google Play Console**

## How to Identify the Correct Build

The NEW build will have:
- Version name: "1.2" (not 1.0 or 1.1)
- Version code: 3
- Build logs showing "targetSdkVersion = 35"
- Different artifact timestamps

## Expected Result

The API level 33 error will be completely resolved once you upload the fresh 1.2 build generated after pushing these changes.
