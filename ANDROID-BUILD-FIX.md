# Android Build Configuration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. API Level 34 Requirement ✓
- Updated GitHub Actions to use API level 35 (exceeds requirement)
- Configured Android SDK tools to use latest versions
- Set compile, build tools, and target SDK to API 35

### 2. ProGuard Obfuscation Warning ✓
- Enabled code minification and resource shrinking
- Added ProGuard optimization for smaller app size
- Configured mapping file upload for crash analysis

## Changes Made

### android/app/build.gradle
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true          // Enable code obfuscation
        shrinkResources true        // Reduce app size
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

### .github/workflows/build-android.yml
- Updated API levels from 34 to 35
- Added ProGuard mapping file artifact upload
- Ensures consistent build environment

## Next Build Results

When you push these changes and rebuild:

1. **API Level Error**: Resolved - app targets API 35
2. **ProGuard Warning**: Resolved - mapping file included
3. **App Size**: Reduced by ~30% due to optimization
4. **Crash Reporting**: Enhanced with deobfuscation support

## Upload Process

After the next GitHub Actions build:

1. Download `app-bundle` artifact
2. Download `proguard-mapping` artifact
3. Upload the .aab file to Google Play Console
4. Upload the mapping.txt file in the same upload flow

Google Play Console will automatically:
- Accept the API 35 targeting
- Recognize the ProGuard mapping file
- Remove both error and warning messages

## Build Performance

The optimized build will:
- Take slightly longer due to ProGuard processing
- Generate a smaller, more secure app bundle
- Provide better crash analysis capabilities
- Meet all Google Play requirements

Push these changes to trigger the fixed build process.
