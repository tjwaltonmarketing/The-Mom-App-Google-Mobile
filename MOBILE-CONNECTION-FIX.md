# Mobile App Connection Fix - Version 25

## Issue Identified
The mobile app shows "Connection failed to https://the-mom-app.replit.app" because it's configured to use an inactive deployment URL.

## Root Cause
- Mobile app hardcoded to use `https://the-mom-app.replit.app`
- This URL is not actively deployed
- Need proper deployment URL for mobile connectivity

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated Mobile Configuration** - Dynamic deployment URL detection
2. **Fixed Version 25** - Resolved GitHub workflow override issue 
3. **Enhanced Connectivity** - Multi-server fallback system with diagnostics

## Current Status
- **Authentication System**: Verified working (login/registration tested)
- **Version Number**: 25 (fixed GitHub workflow override)
- **Mobile Config**: Updated with dynamic URL detection
- **Connection Status**: Shows "Connected (139ms)" but fails on API calls

## Next Steps Required
1. **Deploy to Replit** - Need active deployment URL for mobile app
2. **Update Mobile Build** - Push version 25 with correct server URL
3. **Test Mobile Connection** - Verify mobile app can reach live server

## Technical Details
- GitHub workflow was overriding version to 15 (now fixed to 25)
- Mobile config now uses dynamic deployment URL detection
- Fallback system includes multiple server options
- Connection diagnostics show network is working but wrong URL
