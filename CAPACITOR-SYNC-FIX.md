# Capacitor Sync Fix Applied

## Root Cause Identified
Capacitor maintains its own build configuration cache that wasn't updated when we changed the Android API levels. The bundle you shared confirmed API 33 was still being used despite our configuration changes.

## Solution Applied
1. **Capacitor Sync**: Ran `npx cap sync android` to update Android plugins with new API levels
2. **Gradle Version Alignment**: Fixed plugin Gradle version mismatch (8.7.2 â†’ 8.2.2)
3. **Version Bump**: Updated to version 1.3 (versionCode 4) for fresh build recognition

## Expected Result
The next build will properly target API 35 because:
- Capacitor has synced the Android configuration
- All build files now use consistent API level settings
- Plugin dependencies are aligned with main app configuration

## Next Steps
Push these changes to trigger a fresh GitHub Actions build with version 1.3. This build should resolve the API level 33 error in Google Play Console.
