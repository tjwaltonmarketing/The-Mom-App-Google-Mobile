# Mobile App Connection Solution

## Current Status
- Mobile app shows "Connected (139ms)" - network connectivity is working
- Registration fails with "Connection failed to https://the-mom-app.replit.app"
- Authentication system verified working on local server
- Version 25 ready with all fixes applied

## Root Issue
Mobile app is configured to connect to `https://the-mom-app.replit.app` which is not actively deployed.

## Immediate Solution
1. Deploy the app to Replit's deployment service
2. Update mobile configuration with the live deployment URL
3. Build version 25 with correct server endpoint

## Deployment Steps
1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit to create live deployment
2. Note the deployment URL (usually ends in .repl.co or .replit.app)
3. Update mobile app configuration with this URL
4. Push version 25 to GitHub for mobile build

## Expected Result
Mobile app will successfully connect to live deployment and allow user registration/login.

The authentication system is already verified working - just need the correct deployment URL.
