# Build Status Verification

## Current Configuration âœ“
- targetSdkVersion: 35 (hard-coded)
- compileSdk: 35 (hard-coded)
- versionName: "1.2"
- versionCode: 3

## Critical Question
Are you:
1. Pushing these changes to your GitHub repository?
2. Waiting for a NEW GitHub Actions build to complete?
3. Downloading the FRESH app-bundle artifact (not old ones)?

## The Problem
If you're still seeing API 33 error, you're uploading an OLD app bundle built before these fixes.

## Verification Steps
1. Check your GitHub repository has the latest commits with version 1.2
2. Wait for GitHub Actions to show a successful build with these changes
3. Download the app-bundle artifact from the LATEST build
4. Verify the .aab file shows version 1.2 when uploaded

The API level is correctly configured. The error persists because old builds are being uploaded.
