# Force Android Rebuild - Updated

The Android configuration is now correctly set to API 35, but you downloaded an app bundle built before these changes.

## Current Configuration âœ“
- compileSdkVersion = 35
- targetSdkVersion = 35
- ProGuard minification enabled

## To Get New Build
1. Make any small change to trigger GitHub Actions (like adding a space to this file) 
2. Push the changes to GitHub
3. Wait for the new build to complete
4. Download the fresh app-bundle artifact
5. Upload to Google Play Console

The new build will have API 35 targeting and resolve the error.
